# MCP4728 library for micropython

Helper library for the Microchip MCP4728 I2C 12-bit Quad DAC 

It is based on Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP4728 library by Bryan Siepert
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP4728/blob/master/adafruit_mcp4728.py

Ported to microPython by Alexander Olikevich (openfablab) with some changes:

* Channel properties read from device not only at init but at every call
* Added power down control function
* Added config() function for laconic channel initial setup
* Changed "raw_value" to "value" and channel names from "channel_a" to "a", etc.
* Removed confusing emulation of 16 bit interface
* Fixed incorrect register values types on initialisation 
* Gains values read and write as 1 or 2
* Rewrited Vref control for simplicity

# Usage example (on ESP32):

from machine import Pin, I2C

import mcp4728

i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(27), sda=Pin(4), freq=400000)



#Create the MCP4725 drivers specifying the I2C bus the MCP4728 is connected to and the I2C slave address of the sensor

dac1=mcp4728.MCP4728(i2c,0x60)

dac2=mcp4728.MCP4728(i2c,0x61)



#Set initial value, vref, gain and power mode for channel a

dac1.a.config(0,1,1,0) 



#Get channel b 12-bit current value

dac1.b.value


#Set channel b 12-bit value

dac1.b.value=4095

dac1.b.value=0

dac1.b.value=123


#Get channel b value as a floating point number in the range 0.0 to 1.0

dac1.b.normalized_value


#Set channel b value as a floating point number in the range 0.0 to 1.0

dac1.b.normalized_value=0.51123


#Get channel d Vref

dac1.d.vref


#Set channel d Vref (voltage reference source). Set 0 for VDD or 1 for internal 2.048V reference.

dac1.d.vref=1


#Get channel c gain

dac1.c.gain


#Sets the gain of the channel c if the Vref for the channel is 1 (INTERNAL). Has no effect if the Vref for the channel is 0 (VDD)

#With gain set to 1, the output voltage goes from 0v to 2.048V. If a channel's gain is set 2, the voltage goes from 0v to 4.096V.

dac1.c.gain=1


#Get channel b power state

dac1.b.pdm

#Set channel b power state. 0 for normal operation, or other to turn off most of the channel circuits and connect VOUT to GND by resistor (1: 1 kΩ, 2: 100 kΩ, 3: 500 kΩ).

dac1.b.pdm=0
